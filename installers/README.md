# KeyPod Installers

Flutter supports multiple platform targets and the app will run native
on Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as directly in a
browser from the web. The functionality is identical across all
platforms.

## Android Side Load

On your Android device simply browse to this folder and click on the
`keypod.apk` file. Your browser will ask if you are comfortable to install
the app locally. Choose to do so and you will have an Android native
install of the app.

## Linux tar Archive

+ Download the `keypod.tar.gz` file 
+ `$ tar zxvf keypod.tar.gz`
+ `$ ./keypod/keypod`

## MacOS

The package file `keypod.dmg` can be installed on MacOS. Download
the file and open it on your Mac. Then, holding the Control key click
on the app icon to display a menu. Choose `Open`. Then accept the
warning to then run the app. The app should then run without the
warning next time.

## Web -- No Installation Required

No installer is required for a browser based experience of
PodNotes. Simply visit https://keypod.solidcommunity.au. 

Also, your Web browser will provide an option in its menus to install
the app locally, which can add an icon to your home screen to start
the web-based app directly.

## Windows Installer

Download and run the `keypod.exe` to self install the app on
Windows.


**NOTE**:
- Installers are tracked using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/), please follow [this instruction](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage) to install it (`apt-get install git-lfs` works on Ubuntu/Debian).
- To track a new file type using Git LFS, e.g. `*.psd` files, run `git lfs track "*.psd"` which adds a line in `.gitattributes`, commit the changes in `.gitattributes` and then use `git add/commit/push` to track large files as you would normally do for small text files.
- To see files tracked by Git LFS, use `git lfs ls-files`, and to see the pointer files stored in the Git repository for the LFS tracked files, e.g. `keypod.apk`, type `cd ./keypod; git show HEAD:installers/keypod.apk`
- For further details of migrating large files in a repository to Git LFS, see [this GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/moving-a-file-in-your-repository-to-git-large-file-storage).
