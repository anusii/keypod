# KeyPod Installers

Flutter supports multiple platform targets and the app will run native
on Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, and Windows, as well as directly in a
browser from the web. The functionality is identical across all
platforms.

## Android Side Load

On your Android device simply browse to this folder and click on the
`keypod.apk` file. Your browser will ask if you are comfortable to install
the app locally. Choose to do so and you will have an Android native
install of the app.

## Linux tar Archive

+ Download the `keypod.tar.gz` file 
+ `$ tar zxvf keypod.tar.gz`
+ `$ ./keypod/keypod`

## MacOS

The package file `keypod.dmg` can be installed on MacOS. Download
the file and open it on your Mac. Then, holding the Control key click
on the app icon to display a menu. Choose `Open`. Then accept the
warning to then run the app. The app should then run without the
warning next time.

## Web -- No Installation Required

No installer is required for a browser based experience of
PodNotes. Simply visit https://keypod.solidcommunity.au. 

Also, your Web browser will provide an option in its menus to install
the app locally, which can add an icon to your home screen to start
the web-based app directly.

## Windows Installer

Download and run the `keypod.exe` to self install the app on
Windows.
