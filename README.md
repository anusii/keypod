# KeyPod --- A Simple Key Value Store

KeyPod is a simple key value data store app to serve as a template and
to demonstrate a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) app utilising data
stored in [Solid Pods](https://solidcommunity.au).

The app is a simple tool for displaying a table of pairs of keys and
values.  You can add new pairs, edit the pairs, and delete the pairs,
and have the changes saved to your Solid Pod.

On starting the app you will be presented with the
[solidpod](https://pub.dev/packages/solidpod) login screen (using
`SolidLogin()` from solidpod).
