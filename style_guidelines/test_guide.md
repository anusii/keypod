# Flutter testing guide

Every pull request should include tests. This document outlines the
testing guidelines that we follow. For details on how to write tests,
see [Flutter Testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/overview).

If tests are not included in a pull request, the author should explain
why testing is not needed in the pull request description.

Total test coverage should be at least 90%. If the coverage is less
than 90%, the author should explain why in the pull request
description.

## Unit tests

Unit tests should be used to test individual functions. They should be
used to test the logic of the function. For example, if a function
takes a list as an argument, the unit test should test the function
with different lists to ensure that it works as expected.

## Widget tests

Widget tests should be used to test individual widgets. They should be
used to test the logic of the widget. For example, if a widget takes a
list as an argument, the widget test should test the widget with
different lists to ensure that it works as expected.

## Integration tests

Integration tests should be used to test the interaction between
widgets. They should be used to test the interaction between
widgets. For example, if a widget takes a list as an argument, the
integration test should test the widget with different lists to ensure
that it works as expected.
